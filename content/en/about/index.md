Hello friends. Welcome to my site. quiethacker.com was created as a place for me to store what I know about technology on the internet.

Hosting a site is fun. It's also a skill I consider necessary. Why be an IT man when you can be a website hosting IT man? Exactly.

The site was created using Hugo because Wordpress sucks and octopress go brrrrrr.

Hugo loads fast and makes my bad internet feel like I have gigabit speeds.

Content on this site is usually about anything tech related, with a focus on cybersecurity topics.

Enjoy. This is for educational purposes only. I'm not responsible for you being an idiot.
