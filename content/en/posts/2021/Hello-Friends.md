<h1>Here begins a new story...</h1>

This is the first post in what will hopefully be a long and fruitful string of posts. Most of what will be posted here are things that I come across and think are helpful. Maybe somebody who runs across this site will find some use of it?

Anyway, this site is mainly focused on topics that would typically fall under the topic of <b>cybersecurity</b>. Things like penetration testing / ethical hacking, scripting, general computer related things even, will all be covered here at some point. 

Maybe there will even be some of that web3 crypto cult speak thrown around here and there <code>:smiling_imp:</code>... 

This site was made using Hugo and the Zzo theme. Big props to the creator of the <a href="https://github.com/zzossig/hugo-theme-zzo">Zzo</a> theme. It was super easy to set up and modify. It even came with a whole <a href="https://zzo-docs.vercel.app/zzo">documentation</a> behind it explaining 90% of what the configuration files are for.

Wordpress, while convienient to use, always ends up a buggy, bloated mess whenever I touch it. It has also had some interesting security vulnerabilities in the past. So instead of risking making a site with Wordpress, I went on the search for other alternatives. I came across two options that looked pretty interesting to try. Those were Jekyll and Hugo. 

At first, I was going to make this blog using Jekyll and octopress. Unfortunately, octopress has not been updated in forever. It is also a giant mess of plugins and stuff that would take forever to rummage through and customize to my liking. After messing around with it for a few days, only to realize that it would end up looking like a tunnelsup.com wannabe, I moved on to Hugo. After trying a couple themes, I found the current theme I'm using and it seems to have everything I want.

Thanks for reading this, it's a messy first post mostly because I just needed this for a test post. The next posts should look nicer... Maybe...
